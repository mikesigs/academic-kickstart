# Biography

I've been doing software development for over ten years now. I've stayed pretty focused on
.NET, building business apps with ASP.NET at the core. I spent a few years quite enamoured with Angular.JS, striving to be a unicorn, full-stack dev. More recently I've just been digging the backend, building microservice-based applications with NServiceBus in AWS.

One thing's for sure, I have a passion for learning, and a true love for code. I am happiest when exploring the nitty-gritty details of some new shiny technology, yet even moreso when sharing my knowledge with others.

When I'm not moving bits and pixels around, I can be found spending time with family and friends. I recently moved to a more hospitable place in Canada (now in Calgary, used to be in Winnipeg), So I am thoroughly enjoying all that this new city and surrounding area has to offer. I'm currently learning to ski, and can't get enough of it!

Well that's me. Thanks for visiting my blog. I hope you find what you're looking for!
